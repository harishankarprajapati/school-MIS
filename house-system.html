            <p>MIS has a school House system for extracurricular activities. There are four houses headed by two
                captains (boy, girl) and members of teaching faculty as house masters and members. They look after the
                general progress of their wards in academics, games and sports, co- curricular activities etc. Since all
                competitions are held on house basis, house loyalties are the strongest. A regular record of student
                participation and achievements in House activities is maintained and points awarded to each House.</p>

            <p> <b>Albert Einstein -</b> Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical
                physicist
                who developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside
                quantum mechanics). While best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which has been
                dubbed “the world’s most famous equation”), he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his
                services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
                effect”. The latter was pivotal in establishing quantum theory.</p>
            <p class="pt-4">Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer
                enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led
                to the development of his special theory of relativity. He realized, however, that the principle of
                relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and with his subsequent theory of gravitation
                in 1916, he published a paper on the general theory of relativity. He continued to deal with problems of
                statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the
                motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of
                the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the
                large-scale structure of the universe.</p>

            <p class="pt-5"> <b>Christopher Columbus House -</b> Christopher Columbus (born between October 31, 1450 and
                October 30, 1451 –
                20 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonizer, born in the Republic of Genoa, in what
                is today northwestern Italy. Under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, he completed four
                voyages across the Atlantic Ocean that led to general European awareness of the American continents.
                Those voyages, and his efforts to establish permanent settlements on the island of Hispaniola, initiated
                the Spanish colonization of the New World.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">In the context of emerging western imperialism and economic competition between European
                kingdoms seeking
                wealth through the establishment of trade routes and colonies, Columbus’s speculative proposal, to reach
                the East Indies by sailing westward, eventually received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in
                it a chance to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative spice trade with
                Asia. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in
                the Bahamas archipelago, at a locale he named San Salvador. Over the course of three more voyages,
                Columbus visited the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as the Caribbean coast of Venezuela and
                Central America, claiming them for the Spanish Empire.</p>



            <p class="pt-5"><b>Mahatma Gandhi House -</b> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948)
                was
                the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. Employing non-violent civil
                disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom
                across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: “high-souled,” “venerable”)—applied to him first in
                1914 in South Africa,—is now used worldwide. He is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for “father,”
                “papa.”) in India.</p>

            <p class="pt-4">Born and raised in a Hindu, merchant caste, family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and
                trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed non-violent civil disobedience as an
                expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community’s struggle for civil rights. After
                his return to India in 1915, he set about organizing peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest
                against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in
                1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women’s rights, building religious
                and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, but above all for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.</p>


            <p class="pt-5 pb-5"> <b>Leonardo Da Vinci House - </b> Leonardo di serPiero da Vinci (April 15, 1452 – May 2, 1519, Old
                Style) was an Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician,
                engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more
                than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been
                described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of “unquenchable curiosity” and “feverishly
                inventive imagination”. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and
                perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner,
                the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and “his mind and personality seem to us
                superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote”. Marco Rosci states that while there is much
                speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and
                that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.</p>
